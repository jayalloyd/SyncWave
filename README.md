# SyncWave

🎥 SyncWave

SyncWave is a Zoom-inspired real-time video conferencing application designed to make virtual meetings seamless and interactive. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and modern WebRTC-based technologies, SyncWave enables users to connect, collaborate, and communicate effortlessly — anywhere, anytime.

🚀 Project Status

⚙️ Backend development in progress
The backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB) is currently under active development.
Frontend structure and integration will follow once the signaling and room management systems are in place.

🧩 Tech Stack

Frontend (planned):

React.js (with Vite or CRA)

Redux Toolkit / Context API (for state management)

Tailwind CSS / Material UI (for styling)

WebRTC + Socket.io (for real-time communication)

Backend (in progress):

Node.js + Express.js (API + signaling server)

MongoDB + Mongoose (database)

Socket.io (real-time communication)

JWT Authentication (secure user sessions)

RESTful APIs (for user & room management)

🏗️ Features (Planned)

🔐 Secure user authentication (signup/login)

📞 One-on-one and group video calls

💬 Real-time chat during calls

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Meeting rooms (create/join)

🎥 Screen sharing and recording

🕹️ Host controls (mute/remove participants)

🌐 Responsive UI for web and mobile browsers
